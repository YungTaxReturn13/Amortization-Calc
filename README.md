# Amortization-Calc
An interactive Jupyter Notebook that allows you to generate an amortization table based on inputs

You can either download the jupyter notebook saved or you can also access using [this link to a binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/justinpak13/Amortization-Calc/HEAD). I recommend cloning the repository as there are issues with updating the graphs in a binder.

and then running the cells in the Amortization Application.ipynb file
